            "_The Super Mario Bros. Movie_ is like Fruit Stripe Gum. It’s super colorful and eyecatching, but it seems to instantly lose its flavor and charm. The film is visually stunning and Jack Black is outstanding as Bowser. The big action sequences are like big budget versions of the Mario video games playthroughs with little welcome surprises thrown in.\r\n\r\nBut the film is massively unfunny, the characters are extremely flat, and the flimsy writing is about as complex as an unkempt mustache.\r\n\r\n**Full review:** https://boundingintocomics.com/2023/04/06/the-super-mario-bros-movie-review-plunging-rainbow-colored-nostalgia-to-death/",

            'I am not the demographic and to be honest this isn\'t really a film that I was ever going to like either. The story is beyond simple and the game-based animation - though expertly crafted - did absolutely nothing for me as ninety minutes rolled along devoid of characterisations, thrill or much sense of adventure. I got the feeling this was really an outing for "Mario", "Luigi" and "Peach" designed to satisfy the die-hard fans, or the children - or both, but if you were not in on the game from the start then you are unlikely to have become any more engaged by the end of this fungi-fest. It wouldn\'t be fair to say this is bland - it\'s not designed to challenge or take risks: it\'s fun for those who grew up with "Mario" et al in their lives and I\'m not going to decry that. It\'s colourful, pacy, and at times quite well written but perhaps it ought to have a rating that says if you are over 12 then you should be advised against it?',

            "The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a fun ride through the iconic world of Mario. The screenplay is admittedly very bare bones, and the characters lack depth, but the film still manages to capture the essence of the beloved video game franchise. The writers do not attempt to do anything beyond create a narrative that intentionally puts our characters in worlds and areas that are instantly recognizable to the audience. This makes the film feel like a Mario game come to life so that audiences can say “that is like Mario Kart or Super Smash Bros.” The movie pacing flies at a breakneck speed, and I felt that this movie could have benefited from a slightly longer runtime to flesh out the story and characters a bit more.\r\n\r\nI was initially nervous about how the voice acting would hold up, but I was pleasantly surprised. Chris Pratt's voice as Mario is not over the top, which works well. It would have been extremely annoying to hear the super Italian Mario accent for a full hour and thirty minutes. Jack Black's portrayal of Bowser steals the show and was the best of the film. Anna Taylor Joy and Seth Rogan were good as Princess Peach and Donkey Kong, although I think Rogan may have injected a bit too much of himself in the character.\r\n\r\nThe direction of the film is solid, with great action set pieces and creative camera angles that make the action feel exciting and dynamic. The animation is stunning, with the characters and world directly designed off the games, but with more polish and details than ever before. The lighting is beautiful, with the bright lights of Rainbow Road and the dark, fiery flames of Bowser standing out as highlights.\r\n\r\nOverall, The Super Mario Bros. Movie may not be the deepest or most complex film, but it is a good time for fans of the Mario franchise. The movie captures the fun and whimsy tone of the games and brings it to life on the big screen. While the comedy may not hit every mark, the voice acting, and direction make up for it. I am excited to see where this film series goes next.\r\n\r\nScore: 72%\r\nVerdict: Good",

            "All my three kids used to play Super Mario Bros games and two of them played them a lot when they were younger so this movie was kind of a must-see movie for us.\r\n\r\nFor myself , this felt very much like a movie made for Super Mario Bros fans and less for the general audience.\r\n\r\nThe characters, the completely illogical platform jumping everywhere and the rather childish story are certain to appeal to younger people still playing the game or those that grew up with the Mario Bros games.\r\n\r\nFor me though the movie was ranging from okayish to, sometimes, cringe worthy. Especially the scenes with Bowser starting to sing. Ouch, my ears are still hurting.\r\n\r\nThe best parts of the movie was when they entered the ape kingdom. That was quite fun and so was the car chase on the rainbow road.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the movie was, for me personally, rather forgettable. Not bad just not that good. That said, it is not really a bad movie either. The rotten rating on Woke Tomatoes is entirely undeserved.",

            "FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/tv-reviews/loki-season-1-spoiler-free-review\r\n\r\n\"Loki is yet another extraordinary addition to the MCU, delivering a deep study of the eponymous character while introducing the fandom to the beginning of the Multiverse. The writers do a phenomenal job building the TVA and developing its detailed time concept that tremendously impacts the universe without relying too much on exposition, despite a couple of heavy deliveries. From the award-worthy production design to the addictive, memorable score, every technical aspect is near-perfect. However, the performances completely drive the show, mainly Tom Hiddleston as the iconic villain, but Owen Wilson, Sophia Di Martino, and a few others also shine. Mixed feelings about the finale that might be slightly underwhelming for non-comic-book readers, and also about an unconvincing subplot involving Hiddleston and Di Martino. Still, it's the most important series of the MCU so far, so don't you dare miss it!\"\r\n\r\nRating: A-",

            "Loki started off slow, but man it picks up and keeps you at the edge of your seat through all the multiverse shenanigans twists and turns. This show is incredibly important to the start of the MCU Multiverse and it is a great place for the viewer to start off. The chemistry between Owen Wilson and Tom Hiddleston is fantastic. Sophia Di Martino does an excellent job as Sylvie and makes a stuck up self righteous character in Loki vulnerable.\r\n\r\n**Verdict:** _Excellent_",

            'After a particle accelerator causes a freak storm, CSI Investigator Barry Allen is struck by lightning and falls into a coma. Months later he awakens with the power of super speed, granting him the ability to move through Central City like an unseen guardian angel. Though initially excited by his newfound powers, Barry is shocked to discover he is not the only "meta-human" who was created in the wake of the accelerator explosion -- and not everyone is using their new powers for good. Barry partners with S.T.A.R. Labs and dedicates his life to protect the innocent. For now, only a few close friends and associates know that Barry is literally the fastest man alive, but it won\'t be long before the world learns what Barry Allen has become...The Flash.',
