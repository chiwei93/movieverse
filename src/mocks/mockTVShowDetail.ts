          "FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/tv-reviews/loki-season-1-spoiler-free-review\r\n\r\n\"Loki is yet another extraordinary addition to the MCU, delivering a deep study of the eponymous character while introducing the fandom to the beginning of the Multiverse. The writers do a phenomenal job building the TVA and developing its detailed time concept that tremendously impacts the universe without relying too much on exposition, despite a couple of heavy deliveries. From the award-worthy production design to the addictive, memorable score, every technical aspect is near-perfect. However, the performances completely drive the show, mainly Tom Hiddleston as the iconic villain, but Owen Wilson, Sophia Di Martino, and a few others also shine. Mixed feelings about the finale that might be slightly underwhelming for non-comic-book readers, and also about an unconvincing subplot involving Hiddleston and Di Martino. Still, it's the most important series of the MCU so far, so don't you dare miss it!\"\r\n\r\nRating: A-",

This show is incredibly important to the start of the MCU Multiverse and it is a great place for the viewer to start off. The chemistry between Owen Wilson and Tom Hiddleston is fantastic. Sophia Di Martino does an excellent job as Sylvie and makes a stuck up self righteous character in Loki vulnerable.\r\n\r\n**Verdict:** _Excellent_",
